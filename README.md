# Advent of code 2020

This repo consists of my answers (and sample input)
to the advent of code challenge. Use them if you get stuck or just want to see what others are doing.

I try to maintain clean code in these - if you notice something's amiss (either a horrible refactor or something
completely unclear)
feel free to open a pull request!

## Guide to the repo

Repo should be updated every day in December until Christmas :)

That being said, here's a guide on the current challenges so far and any hints you may find useful.

### Day 1 - javascript

Two sum, and then three sum.

### Day 2 - python

I used a map for this one.

### Day 3 - python

Modulo arithmetic.

### Day 4 - python

Tried an enumeration of sorts and lambdas.

### Day 5 - python

Binary splitting - as suggested by problem statement.

### Day 6 - python

(Ab)using Python Sets.

### Day 7 - python

What should have been a straightforward dictionary problem.

### Day 8, and beyond....

## Additional comments

Python has been a real charm for doing these challenges. I expect to have fun using Java too, however, I'm currently
working on a python project, so I mainly use the questions as a warm up. JavaScript is also fun - and a good way to use
ES5/6/7 features.
